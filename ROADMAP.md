# NCTForge Development Roadmap

**Adopted:** 2026-08-31

**Status:** R1 complete; R2 research contracts in progress

**Style:** Evidence-gated, not feature-count or calendar driven

## Goal

Establish an open, transport-neutral BNCT research and independent-verification
platform that makes geometry, component dosimetry, biological interpretation,
uncertainty, and provenance comparable between codes and institutions.

## R0 — Architecture and risk register

Exit evidence:

- backend-neutral case and physical-dose contracts;
- OpenMC isolated behind a transport interface;
- Apache-2.0 and contribution policy;
- research and Avify Dose IP boundaries;
- synthetic-data-only repository policy;
- documented feasibility risks and acceptance gates.

## R1 — Geometry truth case

Deliver one synthetic DICOM CT and RTSTRUCT case with linked egui views.

Exit evidence:

- DICOM frame of reference and voxel affine preserved;
- axial, sagittal, and coronal orientation independently checked;
- structures round-trip within predeclared geometric tolerances;
- patient identifiers absent by construction;
- malformed or ambiguous geometry is rejected.

The frozen starting case is
[`NF-BNCT-001`](benchmarks/synthetic/nf-bnct-001/SPECIFICATION.md). R1 implements
its synthetic CT, RTSTRUCT, expected masks, and backend-neutral case manifest;
it does not wait for a transport engine.

Implementation status:

- complete: deterministic CT/RTSTRUCT generation;
- complete: patient-space CT ordering and affine validation;
- complete: exact frozen ROI masks, volumes, and LPS centroids;
- complete: malformed frame, plane, spacing, and orientation rejection tests;
- complete: one-command CLI generation and independent verification;
- complete: backend-neutral `case.json` with traversal-safe SHA-256 artifact
  verification;
- complete: UI-independent axial, coronal, and sagittal mappings with linked
  crosshair and independent edge-orientation tests;
- complete: integrity-gated egui viewer with linked axial, sagittal, and coronal
  views, LPS cursor, window/level controls, and RT structure overlays;
- complete: warning-free external CT/RT Structure Set IOD validation with
  `dciodvfy`, plus cross-instance consistency validation with `dcentvfy`, in CI.

## R2 — Physical component truth case

Calculate the four physical BNCT dose components for a simple analytic phantom.

Exit evidence:

- OpenMC version, commit, nuclear data, settings, seed, and inputs recorded;
- B-10, N-14, hydrogen/recoil, and photon definitions cited and tested;
- estimator limitations documented;
- analytic or independently calculated reference tolerances passed;
- statistical uncertainty retained at voxel level.

R2 also requires the response-generation and classification ledger specified by
`NF-BNCT-001`, plus an independent estimator comparison. OpenMC output alone is
not promoted to a reference result.

Implementation status:

- complete: OpenMC 0.16.0 estimator boundary and reaction-filter limitation
  recorded in ADR 0005;
- complete: canonical four-component physical-dose bundle with content-hashed
  profile identity, absolute voxel uncertainty, and independently derived
  physical-total uncertainty;
- complete: versioned explicit-nuclide material and unit-weight fixed-source
  contracts, including frozen machine inputs for `NF-BNCT-001`;
- complete: machine-validated contributor ledger and NJOY partial-KERMA
  generation method, explicitly held at `method_frozen_tables_pending`;
- complete: fail-closed response-set envelope and physical-dose-bundle binding,
  including pointwise neutron-KERMA closure and review-state enforcement;
- complete: case-scoped OpenMC nuclear-data manifest, HDF5 capability
  inspection, artifact verification, and cross-sections mapping preflight;
- complete: resumable, no-overwrite nuclear-data acquisition with frozen
  publisher profiles, redirect confinement, size and publisher-digest checks,
  and receipts bound into manifest schema `0.3.0`;
- complete: acquire the current publisher-matched NNDC neutron archive and
  freeze the ten `NF-BNCT-001` evaluations by path, size, and SHA-256 as an
  unqualified candidate, preserving the different OpenMC-recipe archive digest
  and unresolved equivalence state;
- complete: validate every selected ENDF material identity and generate the ten
  byte-stable NJOY2016.78 production/diagnostic decks with a content-bound,
  no-overwrite `input_preparation_only` manifest;
- complete: byte-stable OpenMC 0.16 input generation with complete scoring and
  audit tally ledgers;
- complete: controlled, no-overwrite NJOY2016.78 execution with exact
  input/output file sets, processor/runtime hashes, structured kinematic
  diagnostics, preserved rejected receipts, and independent artifact
  verification;
- complete: record the first ten-nuclide execution as rejected evidence after
  72 MT 301 violations across N-15, O-16, O-17, and O-18, without clipping or
  silently dropping an isotope;
- in progress: investigate the rejected HEATR diagnostics and independently
  test the affected total-heating responses;
- pending: acquire and inspect the processed official OpenMC ENDF/B-VIII.1
  distribution and compare it with the selected evaluated sources;
- pending: generate the first reviewable response tables only after the
  diagnostic blocker is resolved through a versioned, reviewed data profile;
- pending: smoke execution, statepoint import, and independent estimator
  comparison.

## R3 — End-to-end research alpha

Run a synthetic head case from DICOM through physical dose, a separately
versioned biological model, visualization, DVH, and evidence export.

Exit evidence:

- one-command reproducible run;
- GUI and CLI consume identical engine results;
- physical and biological layers can be inspected separately;
- deterministic manifest binds inputs and outputs;
- independent verifier rejects modified artifacts.

## R4 — Transport-neutral reference platform

Add generic component-dose import and cross-code comparison cases.

Exit evidence:

- published interchange schema;
- at least one result produced outside OpenMC imported without loss of meaning;
- OpenMC and one independent transport path compared on frozen cases;
- public conformance suite and versioned reference outputs;
- Python API supports external biological-model experiments without duplicating
  production evaluation logic.

## R5 — External validation and adoption

Exit evidence:

- independent reproduction by a researcher outside Avila Labs;
- review by a BNCT physicist;
- comparison with measured phantom or commissioned beam data under a written
  collaboration agreement;
- at least two institutions execute the conformance suite;
- methods manuscript and archival software/data release.

## Deferred beyond the research platform

- patient-specific clinical decisions;
- treatment delivery instructions;
- automated segmentation or contour editing;
- facility commissioning claims;
- regulatory submission;
- optimization involving Avify Dose patent subject matter;
- any claim of clinical equivalence to a certified TPS.
