# NCTForge Development Roadmap

**Adopted:** 2026-08-31

**Status:** R1 complete; R2 response qualification paused at its external-evidence gate

**Style:** Evidence-gated, not feature-count or calendar driven

## Goal

Establish an open, transport-neutral BNCT research and independent-verification
platform that makes geometry, component dosimetry, biological interpretation,
uncertainty, and provenance comparable between codes and institutions.

## R0 — Architecture and risk register

Exit evidence:

- backend-neutral case and physical-dose contracts;
- OpenMC isolated behind a transport interface;
- Apache-2.0 and contribution policy;
- research and Avify Dose IP boundaries;
- synthetic-data-only repository policy;
- documented feasibility risks and acceptance gates.

## R1 — Geometry truth case

Deliver one synthetic DICOM CT and RTSTRUCT case with linked egui views.

Exit evidence:

- DICOM frame of reference and voxel affine preserved;
- axial, sagittal, and coronal orientation independently checked;
- structures round-trip within predeclared geometric tolerances;
- patient identifiers absent by construction;
- malformed or ambiguous geometry is rejected.

The frozen starting case is
[`NF-BNCT-001`](benchmarks/synthetic/nf-bnct-001/SPECIFICATION.md). R1 implements
its synthetic CT, RTSTRUCT, expected masks, and backend-neutral case manifest;
it does not wait for a transport engine.

Implementation status:

- complete: deterministic CT/RTSTRUCT generation;
- complete: patient-space CT ordering and affine validation;
- complete: exact frozen ROI masks, volumes, and LPS centroids;
- complete: malformed frame, plane, spacing, and orientation rejection tests;
- complete: one-command CLI generation and independent verification;
- complete: backend-neutral `case.json` with traversal-safe SHA-256 artifact
  verification;
- complete: UI-independent axial, coronal, and sagittal mappings with linked
  crosshair and independent edge-orientation tests;
- complete: integrity-gated egui viewer with linked axial, sagittal, and coronal
  views, LPS cursor, window/level controls, and RT structure overlays;
- complete: warning-free external CT/RT Structure Set IOD validation with
  `dciodvfy`, plus cross-instance consistency validation with `dcentvfy`, in CI.

## R2 — Physical component truth case

Calculate the four physical BNCT dose components for a simple analytic phantom.

Exit evidence:

- OpenMC version, commit, nuclear data, settings, seed, and inputs recorded;
- B-10, N-14, hydrogen/recoil, and photon definitions cited and tested;
- estimator limitations documented;
- analytic or independently calculated reference tolerances passed;
- statistical uncertainty retained at voxel level.

R2 also requires the response-generation and classification ledger specified by
`NF-BNCT-001`, plus an independent estimator comparison. OpenMC output alone is
not promoted to a reference result.

Implementation status:

- complete: OpenMC 0.16.0 estimator boundary and reaction-filter limitation
  recorded in ADR 0005;
- complete: canonical four-component physical-dose bundle with content-hashed
  profile identity, absolute voxel uncertainty, and independently derived
  physical-total uncertainty;
- complete: versioned explicit-nuclide material and unit-weight fixed-source
  contracts, including frozen machine inputs for `NF-BNCT-001`;
- complete: machine-validated contributor ledger and NJOY partial-KERMA
  generation method, explicitly held at `method_frozen_tables_pending`;
- complete: fail-closed response-set envelope and physical-dose-bundle binding,
  including pointwise neutron-KERMA closure and review-state enforcement;
- complete: case-scoped OpenMC nuclear-data manifest, HDF5 capability
  inspection, artifact verification, and cross-sections mapping preflight;
- complete: acquire the official 9.66 GB OpenMC ENDF/B-VIII.1 distribution,
  freeze its case-scoped acquisition receipt and 16 selected artifacts, and
  pass the material-specific transport capability preflight;
- complete: resumable, no-overwrite nuclear-data acquisition with frozen
  publisher profiles, redirect confinement, size and publisher-digest checks,
  and receipts bound into manifest schema `0.3.0`;
- complete: acquire the current publisher-matched NNDC neutron archive and
  freeze the ten `NF-BNCT-001` evaluations by path, size, and SHA-256 as an
  unqualified candidate, preserving the different OpenMC-recipe archive digest
  and unresolved equivalence state;
- complete: validate every selected ENDF material identity and generate the ten
  byte-stable NJOY2016.78 production/diagnostic decks with a content-bound,
  no-overwrite `input_preparation_only` manifest;
- complete: byte-stable OpenMC 0.16 input generation with complete scoring and
  audit tally ledgers;
- complete: controlled, no-overwrite NJOY2016.78 execution with exact
  input/output file sets, processor/runtime hashes, structured kinematic
  diagnostics, preserved rejected receipts, and independent artifact
  verification;
- complete: record the first ten-nuclide execution as rejected evidence after
  72 MT 301 violations across N-15, O-16, O-17, and O-18, without clipping or
  silently dropping an isotope;
- complete: derive and independently regenerate a transported-photon KERMA
  suitability report that rejects the same four nuclides on explicit NJOY
  missing/incomplete photon-data findings;
- complete: compare all ten production MT 301 tables pointwise against the
  official processed OpenMC tables with corresponding grids and no
  interpolation; the maximum relative difference is `4.892060e-7`;
- complete: establish that the official processed tables retain effective
  local-photon fallback for O-17 and O-18, so official-library acquisition does
  not by itself resolve the transported-photon KERMA blocker;
- complete: expose the intended workflow in an evidence-aware egui shell with
  overview, geometry, transport, four-component dose, and evidence workspaces;
  unfinished physics and backend actions remain explicitly disabled;
- complete: add official Avila Labs branding, contextual offline help, and
  guided dim-and-spotlight tours over live workflow controls;
- complete: add a separately versioned alternate-library selection and
  deterministic comparison contract, then run the first complete candidate
  gate with publisher-matched JEFF-4.0; it is rejected with six affected
  nuclides, 120 kinematic violations, no baseline rejection resolved, and two
  new rejections;
- complete: inventory exact MF=6/12/13/14/15 source records for both
  ten-nuclide selections and add source-aware suitability schema `0.2.0`; this
  corrects NJOY's File 12 message to informational when File 13 is valid,
  clearing JEFF N-15 while leaving five full-evaluation candidate rejections;
- complete: independently integrate all eight supported N-15 File 13/File 15
  continuum photon-energy moments for both selections and reproduce 58 shared-
  node NJOY diagnostics within their five-digit print precision;
- complete: independently reconstruct JEFF N-15 MF=6/MT=102 photon first and
  second moments, photon-momentum recoil, and Q-value balance; 33 of 37 source
  nodes fail a conservative 1% screen even though all spectra normalize and
  NJOY's self-bounded kinematic check reports zero violations;
- complete: derive and content-bind the common OpenMC neutron transport domain
  from the exact processed-data manifest and material, then apply it
  symmetrically through domain-aware suitability schema `0.3.0`; all 72
  baseline violations remain in domain, while six of 120 JEFF findings are
  above 20 MeV and O-16 alone clears with zero in-domain violations;
- complete: add evidence-aware suitability schema `0.4.0`, bind the exact H-2
  source and processor-attribution reports to the immutable domain assessment,
  clear all 15 attributed H-2 findings without deleting them, and integrate
  N-15's independent capture-balance rejection;
- complete: expose that evidence-aware gate through Avila Core's hash-bound
  external-checker protocol, preserving the categorical qualification and
  exact remaining-finding count as separate claims while NCTForge retains all
  domain logic;
- complete: partition the 102 remaining in-domain JEFF-4.0 findings into 59
  source-data-blocked C-13/O-18 findings and a 43-finding O-17 reaction queue;
- complete: reproduce all 43 O-17 MT 301 excesses from NJOY's printed
  per-reaction File 6 energy-balance remainders, while retaining all 43 for
  independent physical validation and waiving none;
- complete: add mixed-source selection schema `0.3.0`, NJOY input-manifest
  `0.2.0`, and repeatable profile/receipt CLI binding, then execute the
  ENDF/B-VIII.1 + TENDL-2025 candidate under the frozen method; the six shared
  nuclides reproduce the baseline exactly while all four TENDL substitutions
  remain rejected with 77 kinematic violations (70 in domain), no baseline
  rejection resolved, and none introduced;
- complete: attribute all 43 in-domain TENDL O-17 findings to NJOY's printed
  energy-balance remainders and expose the verified candidate comparison to
  Avila Core through `check-candidate-comparison`; TENDL's duplicated File 3
  grid points make the deeper independent gates uncomputable, which is
  preserved as a source-format finding;
- complete: compute independent File 3/File 6 reaction-level energy-balance
  remainders for JEFF-4.0 O-17 without NJOY; all 43 in-domain samples compute,
  and the independent remainder sum reproduces NJOY's printed `ebal` sums and
  the MT=301 excess within 1.7% at every finding energy, with the MT=91
  processor-internal convention and residual per-product `ebar` differences
  preserved as unreviewed evidence (ADR 0030);
- resolved: the O-17 queue is dispositioned as explained — the non-conservation
  is a documented property of the evaluated File 6 accounting, independently
  reproduced; the baseline photon-coverage findings are data-coverage findings
  (ADR 0031); all findings remain carried in provenance, none waived;
- complete: generate the first response tables under the frozen method —
  `generate-response-tables` folds receipt-bound production HEATR PENDF
  sections (MT=301 total, MT=443 kinematic, MT=407 B-10, MT=403 N-14 partial
  KERMA) onto a 7,526-knot union grid with exact B+N+H closure at every knot,
  and `verify-response-tables` reproduces both artifacts byte-exactly and
  seals the set as independently reviewed under the in-house deterministic
  verification path (ADR 0031); all 72 in-domain kinematic findings are
  carried into the generation report, none waived;
- complete: smoke execution under OpenMC 0.16.0 at the frozen commit —
  `openmc generate` materializes the deterministic deck bound to the reviewed
  response set, the run produces a five-batch statepoint honoring all twelve
  tally contracts, and `compare-openmc-smoke-estimators.py` freezes the ADR
  0007 correlated-diagnostic evidence: executed energy-function tables bitwise
  identical to the sealed set, coupled-heating closure within combined
  uncertainty, component response sum versus the dedicated neutron-heating
  estimator at the 1e-9 relative level, and B-10/N-14 reaction-rate audits
  reproducing the evaluated mean deposited energies within 2e-4;
- complete: statepoint import into the platform result model — `openmc
  collect` reads the newest statepoint through a pure-Rust HDF5 path, binds
  the run header, recorded OpenMC version, and tally contracts to the input
  manifest, normalizes the component tallies into gray per source neutron
  with per-voxel 1-sigma uncertainties, takes the coupled-heating tally as
  the dedicated physical total, and emits a validated
  `nctforge.physical-dose-bundle/0.2.0` whose provenance id binds the
  input-manifest and statepoint SHA-256 digests. The smoke bundle is
  execution evidence only; reference results still require a
  reference-statistics execution under the predeclared acceptance gates.

## R3 — End-to-end research alpha

Run a synthetic head case from DICOM through physical dose, a separately
versioned biological model, visualization, DVH, and evidence export.

Exit evidence:

- one-command reproducible run;
- GUI and CLI consume identical engine results;
- an installable Python alpha wraps the same Rust validation and model contracts
  without duplicating scientific logic;
- physical and biological layers can be inspected separately;
- deterministic manifest binds inputs and outputs;
- independent verifier rejects modified artifacts.

## R4 — Transport-neutral reference platform

Add generic component-dose import and cross-code comparison cases.

Exit evidence:

- published interchange schema;
- at least one result produced outside OpenMC imported without loss of meaning;
- OpenMC and one independent transport path compared on frozen cases;
- public conformance suite and versioned reference outputs;
- Python API supports external biological-model experiments without duplicating
  production evaluation logic.

## Cross-cutting distribution

The accepted distribution boundary is recorded in [ADR
0015](docs/adr/0015-python-and-native-distribution.md): PyPI is the planned
primary scientific-user entry point, Cargo remains the native developer path,
and desktop builds ship as native release artifacts. All three surfaces call the
same Rust contracts.

Implementation status:

- complete: choose the PyO3/maturin mixed-package architecture and prohibit a
  parallel Python dose, geometry, evidence, or qualification engine;
- complete: implement the first bounded Python API over the selected,
  versioned Rust contracts — case generation, verification, and gated loading;
  geometry and ROI inspection; schema-validated manifest and transport-contract
  readers with canonical `to_json` serialization; the honest response-set
  folding gate and backend capability flags — with a 12-test cross-language
  parity suite run against a wheel installed into a clean environment in CI;
- pending: build and smoke-test the supported wheel matrix through TestPyPI;
- pending: review public crate surfaces before enabling crates.io publication;
- pending: produce signed native desktop release artifacts.

## R5 — External validation and adoption

Exit evidence:

- independent reproduction by a researcher outside Avila Labs;
- review by a BNCT physicist;
- comparison with measured phantom or commissioned beam data under a written
  collaboration agreement;
- at least two institutions execute the conformance suite;
- methods manuscript and archival software/data release.

## Deferred beyond the research platform

- patient-specific clinical decisions;
- treatment delivery instructions;
- automated segmentation or contour editing;
- facility commissioning claims;
- regulatory submission;
- optimization involving Avify Dose patent subject matter;
- any claim of clinical equivalence to a certified TPS.
